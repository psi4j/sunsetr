# Introduction

**Sunsetr** is an automatic blue-light filter for Wayland compositors. It automates smooth color-temperature transitions from neutral to warmer tones, designed to reduce eye strain and improve sleep. Sunsetr automatically adjusts your displays based on your [geolocation](configuration/geographic.md) or [manual time settings](configuration/transition-modes.md). It can also be used to persist the same color-temperature and gamma indefinitely, and can alternate between various user-defined [presets](presets/). The controller can integrate with and automate changes in your shell or UI applications via [IPC](advanced/ipc.md).

## Getting Started

To get started, continue to the [Installation](installation.md) guide, then follow the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) guide to set up sunsetr with your compositor.
